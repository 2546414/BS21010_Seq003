# EEG Analysis Tool

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing and visualizing EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. It's designed to assist neuroscientists in processing EEG signals, extracting relevant features, and generating insightful visualizations.

## Features
- EEG data loading and preprocessing
- Advanced filtering techniques
- Feature extraction (power spectral density, coherence, etc.)
- Interactive visualizations (topographic maps, time-frequency plots)
- Statistical analysis of EEG features

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip
