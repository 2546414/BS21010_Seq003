Welcome to the EEG Analysis Tool

This program is designed to assist the streamlining of the process of analyzing EEG data,
making it easier for scientists to extract meaningful insights from complex brain activity recordings.

Key features:
- Automated preprocessing of EEG data
- Advanced filtering techniques
- Feature extraction (e.g. power spectral density, coherence)
- Interactive visualizations
- Statistical analysis of EEG features

Applications:
- Identifying markers of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's
- Studying cognitive processes such as memory retention and decision making processes
- Developing brain-computer interfaces for assistive technologies

Key aim
- To reduce time spent on the tedious process of data manipulation and processing, 
allowing researchers to focus more on interpreting results and advancing their understanding of brain functions.
